                    A close-up view of a womanâ€™s hands typing on a sleek white keyboard, 
                    set on a polished wooden table. Her hands are elegantly poised, with neatly manicured nails, 
                    and the keyboard features a minimalist, modern design. The wooden table, made of light oak, 
                    showcases subtle grain patterns that add warmth and character to the scene. Soft natural lighting bathes the workspace, 
                    creating a calm and focused atmosphere that reflects productivity and elegance.
